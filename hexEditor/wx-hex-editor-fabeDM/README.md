# wxWidgets Hex Editor

Create a minimalistic hex editor using wx widgets.
You may follow the wireframe below when designing your GUI.

![wireframe](images/hex_editor.svg)

At the very least, it must be possible to enter text in either of the input
fields. The text must immediately appear in both fields - once as regular
ASCII text and once as hex representation of the text.
In the hex field, you may only enter hex characters while the text field
must allow all ASCII characters. (65 points)

You'll receive 5 bonus points for each of the following controls for
* creating a new file (simply replacing the current content)
* opening a file that is stored on disk
* saving the current file to disk

These controls can be made available either as menu items, in a toolbar or
as regular buttons.

You have to provide either a `CMakeLists.txt` or a `Makefile` that builds
your program. The program must build without errors in Linux. (10 points)

Edit this [README](README.md) with instructions on how to compile your program.
(5 points)

Provide a `LICENSE` file that correctly contains any open source license and
your name. (10 points)

Push your work to make it available for grading. (10 points)
